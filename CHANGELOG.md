* better & more resilient error handling

###0.2.2 / 2014-09-27
* add support for tagging metrics (not yet used in reports or visualization)

* other minor optimizations
* add gauges for thread pool stats

###0.2.0 / 2014-09-20
* implement metrics contexts (and child contexts)
* make config more friendly
* most used condig options are now set by default
* add logging based on liblog (no fixed dependency - automaticaly wire into existing logging framework)
